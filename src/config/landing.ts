/**
 * Landing page configuration — text content for the project landing pages
 * at /landing (English) and /zh/landing (中文). They introduce the AnvilWiki
 * template itself, NOT the demo game.
 *
 * This is separate from site.ts (which holds the DEMO GAME config).
 * The landing page represents the PROJECT, so its copy lives here.
 *
 * This is the facade of a 5-module family (split in v2.31.1 to keep every
 * file small; the public API and every import path are unchanged):
 *   - landing-types.ts   LandingLocale + LandingContent
 *   - landing-shared.ts  PROJECT_VERSION + GitHub URLs + COMMUNITY_SITES
 *   - landing-en.ts      English copy
 *   - landing-zh.ts      Chinese copy
 *
 * 👉 This file is NOT part of the "apply template" config layer — fork users
 *    don't need to touch it. It describes the AnvilWiki open-source project.
